        <img src="../images/irina.jpeg" alt="Irina">
        <p>I have been working as a Junior Frontend Developer for 2 years in Moscow
            (Russia). But it was 6 years ago. Then I moved to UK. Because of immigration,
            maternity leave and other personal circumstances, I have a gap in work experience.
            I however always remembered how I enjoyed working as a web developer, so I
            decided to refresh my knowledge.
            In order to stay up to date with ever more modern technological advancements
            and updates I went to a course, which lasted 11 months, and also self learned using
            online resources. I am eager to continue my career in web development and
            implement my existing technical and interpersonal skills.</p>
